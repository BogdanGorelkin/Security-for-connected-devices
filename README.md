# Security for connected devices
*This is a student project to solve tasks related to Error correction for transmitting data in communication channel*

When you start the program, you are taken to the console menu, which is implemented for easy navigation through the project.

Check out the [tutorial file](https://github.com/BogdanGorelkin/Security-for-connected-devices/blob/main/Tutorial.pdf) for the details of the first two point of the project. </br>In addition to the tasks outlined in this tutorial, was implemented the program for finding a cyclic generator polynomial when dividing the binomial x-1 without remainder. For run this part of the program, please choisee third point of menu

######  Theory:
Cyclic codes are a branch of error-correcting coding theory that demonstrates a fruitful combination of mathematical elegance and practical utility. If the code is cyclic and the vector

`U = (U0,U1,...,Un−1)`   belongs to the code, then the vector
 
`U* = (Un−1,U0,U1,...,Un−2)` also belongs to the code.

The spectrum of the code is the set of weights w of allowed codewords s with the corresponding list indicating the number of scales. In other words, the spectrum of the code is a dictionary {weight: quantity}.
